Void elements are elements with no content.

- **Semantics**

> Semantics refers to the *meaning* of a piece of code. In HTML the h1 element is a semantic element. This semantic element gives the meaning of "top level heading on your page" to the content.  HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling.  Styling should be solely handled by CSS.
