# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript Notes

## General Notes

### JS Intro Paragraph

JS is a lightweight compiled programming language with first-calss functions.  It is used for scripting web pages, but many non browser environments also use it.  JS is not Java.  They are very different languages with different syntax, semantics, and usage.

### Intro to JavaScript

There are 3 major parts of Javascript.  The language itself, the DOM API, and the server API.  You can either embed the JS code directly in the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external Javascript File.  We do that using the \<script> tag.  

### Javiscript input with prompt and confirm

Prompt will show a pop-up window with the text provided and a textbox the user can fill in.  When the user presses ok, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt function.  Confirm gives the user a popup which returns true if they select ok and false if they press cancel or hit esc.

### Variables

There are 4 ways to declare a JS variable: var, let, or const.  Variables are containers for storing data.  If you want a general rule, use const.  If the variable can change use let.  Variables must have unique names.  They must begin with a letter.  Variables are case sensitive.
