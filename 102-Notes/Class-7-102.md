# Programming with JavaScript Notes

## General Notes

### Control Flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.  Code is run top down, unless the computer runs across structures that change the control flow such as conditionals and loops.  When you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects the order of execution.

## JavaScript Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task.   The function is executed when something invokes it (calls it).  A function is defined with the keyword function followed by a name followed by parentheses.  The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas.  The code executed by the function is then placed inside of curly brackets.  Function arguments behave as local variables inside the function.  This means that the variables can only be accessed from within the function.  Functions can be invoked when an event occurs, when it is invoked in the JS code, or automatically if it is self invoked.  Functions often compute a return value which is returned back to the caller.  Functions are useful because they can be reused.

## Operators

- Assignment operator "="
- Addition operator "+"
- Multiplication Operator "*"
etc.  List of operators can be found here: [Link to operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)

## Answer

- What is control flow?

> The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

- What is a JavaScript function?

> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.  They are useful because they can be reused.  Write the code once and then use it many times.

- What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function

> invoking or calling a function is when something occurs that causes the function to execute.  This can be when an event occurrs, when it is called in the javascript code, or automatically if it is self invoked.

- What are the parenthesis for when you define a function?

> The parentheses contain the parameters that will be passed as arguments into the function when it is invoked.
