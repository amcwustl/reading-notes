# Operators and Loops Reading Notes

## General Notes

### Expressions and Operators

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.  Expressions can have side effects or purely evaluate.  
Operators follow order of operations based off of higher precedence.  
Comparison operatorrs return a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.  
Some examples include "==", "!=", "<", "<=" etc...

### Loops

Loops repeat an action some number of times.  
For loops repeat until a specified condition returns false.  
The syntax is for (initialization; condition; afterthought)  
statement  
  
While loops executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.  
The syntax is while (condition)  
statement  
  
If the condition becomes false, the while loop will stop executing.

## Answer

- What is an expression in JavaScript?

> A valid unit of code that resolves to a value.  There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely *evaluate*

- Why would we use a loop in our code?

> We would use a loop in our code to repeat some code some number of times (the number of times could be zero)

- When does a for loop stop executing?

> A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

- How many times will a while loop execute?

> A while loop will execute as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.
