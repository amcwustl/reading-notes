# Class 13 Reading Notes

This reading covers how to store some data on a users local computer to avoid having to store data server side.

## Local Storage and How to Use it on Websites

- Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

> A developer would use local storage when you don't want to force a user to sign up so that we can store data on the server side.  Local storage allows us to keep a key on a user's computer and read it out when the user returns.

- What information should not be stored in local storage?

> Sensitive personal information, authentication tokens and session data, critical app data, and large amounts of data should not be stored in local storage.

- Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

> Generally local storage only stores string values.  We can convert to a JSON to get around this limitation.
