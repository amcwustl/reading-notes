# Class 14 Psychological Safety

- What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

> Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, high social sensitivity, and empathy for other team members.

- Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

> In my last professional setting I was on a team with very bad psychological safety.  We had a leader who operated from a place of blame and fear.  It made all team members afraid to speak out for fear of being taken to task for mistakes.  This meant that we were slow to identify broader problems as people didn't want to communicate openly about them.  If we had an atmosphere where people felt safe, we likely could have solved many of the problems that ended up being terminal for some projects.

- What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and team members?

> When teams with a high degree of psychological safety work together, the collective capabilities of the team become much higher than the capabilities of their smartest or most capable members.  It allows everyone to contribute and for the team to achieve things that would not be possible individually.
