# Class 4 Reading Notes

These readings are important because adding links to HTML files is a requirement for pretty much all web pages.  Additionally, the CSS readings help us to understand how to get things where we want them on the page.  For JavaScript, functions are a fundamental building block of pretty much everything dynamic on the web.

## Creaing Hyperlinks

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

> We would wrap the text inside of an \<a> element.

- The `href` attribute contains what information?

> The href attribute contains the Hypertext Reference or target that contains the web address.

- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

> We can keep our link text as short as possible.  We can not repeat the URL as part of the link text.  We can not say "link" or "links to" as part of the link text.  We can minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.

## CSS Layout

- What is meant by "normal flow"?

> Normal flow is the way elements lay out on a webpage if no CSS has been applied to change the way they behave.

- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

> Block level elements grow along the block dimension to accommodate the content.  Inline elements size is just the size of the content.  You can set height and width on some inline elements.  Inline elements don't appear on new lines, they just sit along the same line as any adjacent content as long as there is space for them to do so.

- ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

> Static.  This means put the element into its normal position in the document flow.

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

> Absolute positioniing removes the element from normal document flow.  This means we can create isolated UI that doesn't interfere with the layout of other elements.  This could be things like popup boxes, control menus, rollover panels etc

- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

> Fixed positioning fies an element in relative place to the visible viewport whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positoned ancestor.

## Learn JS

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

> A function declaration defines what will happen if a function is used.  A function invocation actually uses the code within the declaration by calling it with a pair of parentheses ().

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

> A paramater are the names listed in the functions definition that will be passed into the function.  The arguments are the actual values passed into the function when it is invoked.

## Miscellaneous

- Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

> One of the main benefits of pair programming is abstracting yourself out of the requirements of actually writing the code and being able to explain verbally what the code should do.  This is useful because it allows your brain to think about the big picture as opposed to the mechanics of how it is actually implemented.  This is a critical skill to develop in the long run so I can see how this would be very useful.
> Another benefit is developing social skills.  Networking will be very important for finding a job after this experience so I see a lot of value in being able to interact well with other programmers.  With most jobs coming through reference, working well with others is critical to career success.

## Things I want to know more about

- Anonymous functions seem useful but I don't really understand how they are used.
