# Class 6 Reading Notes

These readings go over the basics of how to create and use objects within JavaScript, as well as the DOM and how JavaScript interactts with it to make changes to a web page.

## JavaScript Object Basics

- How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

> An object is a collection of related data and functionality.  It allows us to store additional data about our object and then access it with methods or functions that we build.

- What are some advantages to creating object literals?

> Object literals allow to transfer structured related data because it is contained within the object.  Sending a single object will be much more efficient than sending each or its component parts individually.

- How do objects differ from arrays?

> Objects differ from arrays in that they contain key value pairs whereas arrays are just lists of values.  Additionally, they allow us to create methods that allow us to easily access specific data from within them or perform a function built into the object.

- Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property instead of dot notation.

> You would need to use bracket notation instead of dot notation if an object property name is held in a variable.

- Evaluate the code below.  What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?

> The term this refers to the current object the code is being written inside.  If we need to create many object literals, it allows us to use the same method definition for every object we create.

## Introduction to the DOM

- What is the DOM?

> The DOM is the document object model which is the data representation of the structure of a document on the web.  It represents the page so that programs can change the document.

- Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript

> Javascript allows us to interact with the DOM and manipulate the objects contained therein.  Without the DOM, Javascript wouldn't have a model or a way of interacting with the web pages component parts.

## Things I want to know more about

- What does it mean that objects are represented as nodes in the DOM.

- The DOM interfaces section didn't make sense to me.
