# Class 13 Reading Notes

These readings cover the basics of CRUD which will allow us to create API's on our backend and connect to a database.

## CRUD Basics

Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

> We would use a PUT request to update a record.

Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

> Update and Delete require an ID parameter.

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

- Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

> RESTful API's often follow CRUD operations as a way of interacting with the resources.  Create in REST is a POST to an endpoint.  Read is a GET, Update is a PUT, Delete is a Delete.

- If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

> 1. Create a server file with necessary packages (express, middleware, mongoose etc)
> 2. Define endpoints with CRUD operations
> 3. Define schema for database and seed with data for testing
> 4. Connect to the database and define what gets sent on each type of request to the API.
> 5. Test all the endpoints via an application like thunderclient.
