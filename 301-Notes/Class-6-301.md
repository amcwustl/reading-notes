## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

> In my last professional setting I was on a team with very bad psychological safety.  We had a leader who operated from a place of blame and fear.  It made all team members afraid to speak out for fear of being taken to task for mistakes.  This meant that we were slow to identify broader problems as people didn't want to communicate openly about them.  If we had an atmosphere where people felt safe, we likely could have solved many of the problems that ended up being terminal for some projects.

- How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

> This article shows me the importance of listening as much as I speak in team settings. It helps create a better environment if everyone has the autonomy to speak up and be heard by all team members.
