## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

This reading shows the importance of practice and continuous improvement in programming skills.  It is important to push outside of our comfort zone, take on new challenges, and engage in activities that provide feedback if we want to grow as programmers.  
Deliberate practice is a way of focusing on activities that will actually help us to improve in the long run.  We should be seeking opportunities for deliberate practice in order to facilitate growth.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

This video teaches the importance of having a growth mindset when facing challenges.  When facing challenges, we should focus on the process, not on the results.  We should welcome challenges because that is how we grow, not by doing things we already know how to do.

## Alain de bottom on Redefining Success

This talk focuses on redefining success away from society's current definition focused on wealth, status, and achievements in order to prioritize our well-being and personal growth.  We should emphasize self-awareness, empathy, and finding fulfillment in everyday activities.

## Emotional Intelligence

It was interesting to me to the variance in my score across the different categories.  Based off of my responses, my strengths are social awareness and relationship management while the things I could improve upon the most are self-awareness and self-management.  This resonates with me because I do find that I normally react and respond to my surroundings without a lot of introspection about my own feelings.  I am used to managing social situations and dealing with others in an empathetic way, but I rarely examine my own motivations for why I do what I do.  In order to improve, I could work on analyzing my own actions and words from time to time and be more aware of my emotions and how they lead to my behaviors.

## Assess your biases

Generally, my scores across the categories were relatively good because this is a topic I do spend a fair amount of time thinking about.  The category where I scored the lowest was the "cultivate connection" section.  I tend to form my own opinions about these topics and spend a fair amount of time reading about them, but i don't do a good job of engaging with others about bias in the workplace.  I don't seek a lot of outside help to form my opinions or ask for feedback from friends, leaders, or peers.  In the future, I could strive to improve this by being more open to feedback, letting others lead conversations more often, and actively asking for support in checking my own biases.
