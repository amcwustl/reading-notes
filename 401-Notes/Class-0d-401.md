# Engineering Readings

- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

> When I go to a potential employer, I will bring my perseverance when faced with things I don't know how to do.  I may not come in as the strongest candidate, but I can commit to outperforming people who start at a higher knowledge base because I know that from a personality perspective that I am driven most by achieving competence in everything I work on.

- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

> When i get stuck, i will:  
> 1. Understand the problem completely.  I will read the problem statement multiple times to make sure I understand everything and identify any gaps in my knowledge about the problem.
> 2. Solve the problem manually.  Instead of jumping straight into code, I will write out the logic I want to implement and then replace it with code.
> 3. Break down the problem into subproblems.  If I break a complex task into more manageable pieces, it will help me solve the bigger picture.
