# Class 1 Reading Notes

These readings cover the basics of Java and why Java needs to be compiled as opposed to interpreted languages.  These readings are important because they set the foundation for learning a new programming language.

## Java Basics

- What does “strong typed” mean?

> Strong typed means that Java enforces rules of type during compilation.  Data must adhere to specific data types and cannot be implicitly converted.

- What are the primitive data types?

> The primitive data types are byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char.

## XKCD Compiling

- Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.

> In Java, the code is written in human readable form because computer's only understand ones and zeros, but we would struggle to write complex programs in that format.  in order to make the computer understand our code, it needs to be compiled into machine readable language.  However, Javascript is interpreted directly by a separate program (a web browser).  This interpreting is built into the other program so it does not need to run through a compilor prior to being executed by the programmer.

- Does code complining mean that it works correctly?

> No, code can be syntactically correct and compile, but still have bugs in it that can lead to unexpected errors.

## Reading Java Documentation

- How many keywords does Java have?

> There are 53 keywords in Java.

- How do you print words to the console in Java?

> `System.out.println()`

## Things I want to know more about

- With interpreted languages like Javascript, does the code still run through a compilor that is built into the web browser?  If not, how does the computer know what to execute and render in the browser?
