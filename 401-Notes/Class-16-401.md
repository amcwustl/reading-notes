# Class 16 Reading Notes

This reading covers using Springs built in security methods as opposed to importing a library like Bcrypt.

# Spring Security Overview

- What does it mean to authenticate a user?

> Authentication verifies who a user is.

- What does it mean to authorize a user?

> Authorization means what is the verified user allowed to do.  Sometimes it is also called access control.

- What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?

> It can return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.  It can throw an
AuthenticationException if the input is an invalid principal.  It can return null if it cannot decide.

## Things I want to know more about

- I don't really understand how authorization is implemented in this framework.  What exactly are AccessDecisionVoters?
