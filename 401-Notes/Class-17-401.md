# Class 17 Reading Notes

This reading covers using OAuth in Spring applications to delegate authorization to another well known provider.  This is important because it will allow us to use preexisting credentials for users to access content without them needing to create a new username and password.

## OAuth

> Oauth can provide a way of delegating the authentication process to well known providers like google.  When a user logs in using Oauth, they grant your application permission to access their basic information from the auth provider.

- Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?

> The authentication providers covered are GitHub and Google.
