# Class 18 Reading Notes

The reading today is important because it introduces many to many relationships which are common in structured databases as a relationship between tables.

## Many to many relationships

- Name a few examples of real world ManyToMany relationships.

> At a company, an employee may be assigned to multiple projects, and each project will have multiple employees assigned to it.  This is a many to many relationship.  Another example would be students and grades.  Each student will get different grades in different classes, and each grade will be assigned to many different students.

- Explain the significance of a join table for ManyToMany relationships.

> A join table resolves the many to many association, eliminates the need for composite keys, and enables efficient querying.

- What are the values held within a join table?

> The join table contains pairs of foreign keys from both sides of the relationship.

## Security: a humorous overview
