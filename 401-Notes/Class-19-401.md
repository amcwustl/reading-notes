# Class 19 Reading Notes

## Purely Functional Programming, from Wikipedia

- Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

> In purely functional programming, the state of data strucutres is not changed directly.  Instead when a change is needed, a new data structure is created leaving the original unchanged.  This is the concept of immutability.

- Define purely functional programming.

> Purely functional programming is programs built using pure functions which always produce the same output for the same input and has no side effects on the program state.

- How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

> The difference will largely be in the immutability of data structures.  They would also rely much less on global variables.
