# Class 2 Reading Notes

These readings cover how to import packages in Java, loops in Java, and Java arrays.  These readings are important because they show some of the foundational knowledge necessary for building a Java program.

## Java Imports

- Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.

> Importing built in packages is similar to using a blueprint and prebuilt parts when building a garden shed.  Technically, I could figure everything out on my own and cut everything to size, but the work has already been done before so it is much easier to build on top of what others have done in the past.  In Java, you could build classes to handle hings like dealing with sql, but it is much easier to import the java.sql package and use those prebuilt classes and methods.

- Explain the steps for creating a new package in IntelliJ.

> In IntelliJ, you right click on the source folder.  Go to new and then package.  Enter the package name.  Now you can create classes, interfaces, and so on inside the package.

## Different types of loops in Java

- Which loop types use a loop counter?

> A for loop uses a loop counter.

- Explain the difference between While and Do-While loops.

> The do-while loop is the same as a while loop except for that it evaluates the conditional after the first iteration of the loop instead of before it.

## Java Arrays

- Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.

> binarySearch will search the array for the specified value using the binary search algorithm.  It will return the index of the search key.
> equals will return two if two specified arrays are equal to each other.
> fill will assign the specified value to each element of the array.

- How is the size of an array determined in Java?

> The size of the array is determined at declaration of an array in Java.

## Things I want to know more about

- Is there a way to store different data types in the same array?
