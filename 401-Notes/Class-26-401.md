## Android Fundamentals

- What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

> An intent in Android Studios is an object that serves as a bridge for communication between different components within an Android appliction.  It encapsulates an operation to be performed along with potential data to be passed along with it.  Intents might be used to start an activity like launching a settings activity when a user clicks the settings button.  It could open a web page by passing a URL when a user clicks a link.

- Describe an Activity in your own word.

> Activities are the building blocks of an apps UI.  They are a single screen where the user can interact with the application. In webdev, this would be like a single HTML page where a user can perform certain operations, or navigate to other pages (activities).
