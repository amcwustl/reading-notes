# Class 28 Reading Notes

This reading covers RecyclerView in Android which is important because it allows us to take lists of data and create dynamic scrollable views that will recycle elements to save on resources and power.

## RecyclerView for Displaying Lists of Data

- What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?

> It is dynamic because it can handle large data sets and instead of destroying views when they are off the screen, it recycles them using the next piece of data from the data set allowing for a dynamic smooth scrolling experience.  It cuts down on resources and power requirement in our applications.

- Share a screenshot of a recycler view in an application you use!
