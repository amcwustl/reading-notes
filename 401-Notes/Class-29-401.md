# Class 29 Reading Notes

These readings are important because they introduce us to a more robust way of storing application data than shared preferences.  This will allow us to create applications that require persisting data across activities and across sessions.

## Saving Data With Room

- What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?

> Room is wrapped around SQLite.  It seems like this is a good choice because SQLite is designed to be a lightweight which means it is a good choice for mobile devices with limited resources.

- Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?

> Rooms have a persistence layer that is similar to JPA.  Also both use the concept of entities.

- Describe a DAO in your own words

> A data access object serves as a bridge between the application and the database.  It defines the methods for accessing and interacting with the stored data instead of writing raw SQL queries, the DAO methods can encapsulate those operations.
