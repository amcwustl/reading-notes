# Class 30 Reading Notes

This reading is important because it introduces us to Amplify which we will be using to integrate AWS services into our Android applications.

## What is AWS Amplify

- What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?

> Alternatives to Amplify are firebase and netlify.  The main advantage is that Amplify directly integrates with AWS' backend services.  This allows for rapid and easy usage of things like storage, auth, and data pipelines.  Some of the disadvantages of using Amplify are that you won't learn how to use the underlying AWS services that Amplify integrates for you.  Additionally, collaboration can be difficult in the Amplify environment and it may be more geared towards solo developers.

- What AWS Region is closest to you?

> Seattle,  US  
> Zone Name: us-west-2-sea-1a  
> Parent Region: US West (Oregon)
