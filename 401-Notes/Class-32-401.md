# Class 32 Reading Notes

These readings are important because they explain the difference between GraphQL and the RESTful API's that we have been working with to this point.

## Intro to Serverless, AWS Amplify, & GraphQL Intro

- What makes an API RESTful?

> An API is RESTful if it is stateless (the server doesn't store any client state between requests), all info is passed in the request itself.  The client and server must be separate entities.

- What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

> GraphQL allows clients to request only data they need, reducing the over-fetching and under-fetching of data that is common in REST API's. It is also schema based which can make it easier to understand API's.  One of the downsides is it can be more complex to set up and maintain the schema as compared to a REST API.

- Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

> Serverless means that the cloud provider handles all the infrastructure, scaling, and server management.  This doesn't mean that there are no servers, but rather that the individual developer doesn't need to worry about server provisioning or capacity planning.
