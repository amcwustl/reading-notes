# Class 33 Reading Notes

This reading is important because it introduces asynchronous methods in Java which will allow us to make requests without freezing the UI of our applications.

## GraphQL Relationships and CompletableFuture in Java

- Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.

> Asynchronous means that things do not occur in the exact sequence written in the program.  Asynchronous allows the program to continue with other operations while time consuming methods are running at the same time.

- What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?

> The benefit of asynchronous methods is allowing tasks to be executed without blocking the main program flow.  This can lead to better utilization of processors as tasks can run in parrallel. Also this prevents time consuming tasks from freezing the UI of an application.
