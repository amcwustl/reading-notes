# Class 36 Reading Notes

This reading is important because it is an introduction to cognito which will allow us to add auth to our amplify applications.

## Amplify and Cognito

- Where in your application should you check the current auth session?

> Auth should be placed at an entry point to the application like onCreate.

- What is the command that is used to push your changes to the cloud?

> `amplify push`

- What does Amplify Auth do for your application?

> Amplify auth provides authentication and authorization functionality for the application. It integrates user sign-up, sign-in, and other auth related features. It provides security and handles token management and storage of user credentials for us abstracting it away from the developer.
