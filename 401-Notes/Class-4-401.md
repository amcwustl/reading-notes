# Class 4 Reading Notes

These readings cover classes and objects in Java and how to create them.  These readings are important because classes and objects are at the heart of programming in Java.  These readings also cover binary and hexidecimal notation for numbers.

## Java OO Tutorial

- Explain the difference between an object and a class.

> In Java,  a class is a template for creating objects.  An object is an instance of a class.

- Name two types of state that a Student object might have.

> Personal information and academic information i.e. name and grades.

- Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.

> Enrolling in courses and personal behaviors. i.e. setCourses() and takeExam()

## Java Classes

- Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.

> It is a special method to initialize the object when it is created.  Constructors are called when using the `new` keyword.

- Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).

 ```
public class Student {

}
```


## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

- What is the value of the binary number 1101?

> 13

- Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.

> 110100, 34
