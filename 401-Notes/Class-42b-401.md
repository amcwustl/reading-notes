## Microsoft and the DoD

This article was interesting to me because at first I was unsympathetic to the employees who are upset about these contracts. My feeling was that there is no requirement for them to work at Microsoft and they will certainly have other jobs available to them should they decide that Microsoft's values don't align with their own.  However, after reading the article it was a bit more nuanced than that.  I do find it concerning that engineers working on projects were not necessarily informed in advance that their work was being used on a platform to increase military lethality.  I don't necessarily take issue with Microsfot pursuing these contracts as having a defense industry is certainly necessary, but it doesn't feel appropriate to have individual employees not informed of how their work will be used. I do think the simple solution here is that employees working on defense technology should be notified upfront and given the opportunity to move to a new team or leave the company if they are not comfortable with it.

## Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

This article was interesting to me because it speaks with fairly high certainty about future issues and outcomes that to me seem far from certain.  I tend to take these articles with a grain of salt because there is a tendency towards alarmism when writing about the future.  However, I did agree with a lot of the author's points and do feel that we are at a critical moment in history where we can decide how these technologies will impact our future society. One of the main problems I see is getting any kind of societal buy in behind regulation which is the only solution to prevent the worst side of AI from coming to the forefront. Without general public knowledge, I don't see politicians being pressured or particularly interested in regulating this industry which will have a ton of unpredictable affects on the way our future plays out.
