# Class 6 Reading Notes

These readings cover more on objects and classes in Java, the use of the static keyword, and singleton design pattern.  These readings are important because understanding objects and classes is foundational to working in Java.  Additionally, static will allow us to access methods of a class outside of an object of the class which is useful in many different scenarios.

## Java OO Tutorial

- What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

> An object is an instance of a class.  In the real world, this could be compared to a single bicycle being an object that is an instance of the class of bicycles made from the same blueprint.  Once the blueprint (class) is created, we can make bicycle objects that all have the same structure but may have different state (what gear are they in, how fast are they going etc..)

- Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java.

> In Java, a class can inherit traits or commonly used state and behavior from a super class.  In non technical terms, this can be compared to the way that different kinds of bicycles can inherit properties from the superclass of bicycle.  A mountain bike and a road bike are different classes, but they inherit some traits in common from the bicycle.

## Java Static Keyword

- Static methods are also called what? Why?

> They are also called class methods because a static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.

- How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

> We can access a variable of a class using dot notation on the class itself as opposed to on an actual object of the type class.

## Java Singleton Class

- What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

> A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem.  An analogy from my previous work experience would be a blueprint in architecture.  When designing a building, the architects follow a certain pattern to outline the structure and layout of other design elements.  These blueprints serve as a guide for implementing the building.

- What is a Singleton?

> A singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object.
