### General Notes:

Text editing software is widely customizable and available through many different sources.  In general, an individuals decision to use a specific product is a matter of preference.  Computers even come with a form of text editing software preinstalled.

The preinstalled text editing software (notepad or text edit) are bare bones implementations of a text editor.  While it is possible to design a website fully in these softwares, there are no additional features intended to make it easier for the coder.  There is no code completion, syntax highlighting, or extensions readily available.

By contrast, there are many downloadable coding specific text editors available on the marketplace (for free or for a cost).  Some examples of these kinds of editors are:
- Notepad ++
- Visual Studio Code
- BB Edit
- Atom
- Brackets
These text editors come with many options and features designed to make it easier to code in the environment.  The best way to choose an editor is to gain experience in them and determine what features are required for your specific work.
