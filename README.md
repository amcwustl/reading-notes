### Growth Mindset:
Growth mindset to me means keeping a positive frame of mind towards the growth when learning new skills.  It means not getting frustrated when things don't click immediately, and understanding that with perseverance, all obstacles can be overcome.

***3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:***

1. Knowing that others may be struggling with the same issues I am (and asking for help)
2. Taking breaks when I feel myself having negative emotions towards my roadblocks
3. Take stock at regular intervals to remind myself of how far I have come
